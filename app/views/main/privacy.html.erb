                  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <div>Effective Date: 07/01/2015</div>
                <h2>1.  Overview</h2>
                <p>CityPulse knows that you care how information about you is collected, used, and shared. With this in mind, we’ve designed our product and service to protect the privacy of our customers and clients. We’ve tried our best to explain our practices below as simply and clearly as possible and we’re here to answer any additional questions you may have at <a href="mailto:privacy@citypulseapp.com?Subject=Privacy Inquiry" target="_top">privacy@citypulseapp.com</a>.</p>
                <p>By using this site and/or any of CityPulse’s online or mobile products and services, you agree to this privacy policy.</p>
                <p>From time to time, we may modify this Policy so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy we will notify you via a notice on our <a href="http://www.citypulseapp.com">home page</a> prior to the changes taking effect.  If you continue to use our online or mobile products, it will tell us that you’ve accepted the changes.</p>
                <h2>2.  What Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>Certain Wi-Fi enabled devices regularly send signals known as probe requests to announce their presence to nearby wireless networks.  CityPulse senses these signals when these Wi-Fi enabled devices enter client locations.  From these signals CityPulse collects the following information from each device: the time the device was first seen, last seen, number of times seen, and Media Access Control (MAC) address.  The MAC address is a unique identifier comprised of letters and numbers to identify the device to wireless networks.  Although MAC addresses are device specific, they do not identify the owner of the device or disclose other personal information.</p>
                <h2>3.  How we Use the Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>The information CityPulse collects is used to determine the flow of customers at client locations. The data is aggregated and anonymized to provide businesses with general information about their foot traffic such as customer count, frequency, and lengths of stay.  Unique identifiers, such as MAC addresses, are not provided to the businesses and we contractually prohibit them from attempting to use the data to identify specific individuals.</p>
                <h2>4.  How We Save the Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>The information CityPulse collects (as set out above) is securely transmitted directly to the CityPulse server and database.  Google App Engine hosts the CityPulse server and Google Cloud SQL hosts the CityPulse database.  All data stored on the CityPulse server and database is subject to Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/policies/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</p>
                <p>None of the information collected is stored locally on the CityPulse sensor.  The only information stored locally on our wireless sensor is the network name and password of the business’s wireless network, as well as a unique CityPulse ID. This information allows our sensor to automatically connect to the business’s network to securely transmit the information CityPulse collects.</p>
                <h2>5.  Our Website Privacy Policies</h2>
                <p>All data collected from or submitted on the CityPulse website is subject to the below terms.</p>
                <p>You can use our site to register an account to access CityPulse’s aggregated data analytics about your business. We use Google third-party services for hosting and analytics, meaning that at that time of your account creation we will only collect your first name, last name, Gmail email address and Google ID. You will log in to your account using your Gmail login information. Your Gmail password is always maintained within Google’s own servers and is not shared with CityPulse. For more information about Google’s privacy policy, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy</a>.</p>
                <p>CityPulse will associate your Gmail account with a unique CityPulse ID that we assign you and with the Google Places ID for your business. For more information about Google’s Places ID, please visit <a href="https://developers.google.com/places">https://developers.google.com/places</a>.</p>
                <p>You can use Google’s authentication to login and see our aggregated business analytics data. We may also use your Gmail address to provide you with important CityPulse notices. The information we collect is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except under the circumstances described in this policy or when we have your permission.</p>
                <p>We use cookies and/or web beacons to improve the experience of our websites. If you are not familiar with these terms, you can learn more about them on <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">this site</a>. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a> or the guidance provided by your individual web browser if you’d like help in managing your cookie preferences. We may also use anonymous and aggregated information from industry-standard website analytics, like Google Analytics, to better design our website.</p>
                <p>We never collect or maintain information on our website from visitors we know to be under the age of 13, and our website is in no way structured to attract visitors from that age group.</p>
                <h2>6.  Other Important Information</h2>
                <p>We may release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, as required by a warrant or court order, to enforce our policies, or protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. We only share your activity on our website with third parties according to the terms described above and we do not currently respond to 'Do Not Track' signals.</p>
                <p>If you have any comments or questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@citypulseapp.com?Subject=Privacy Inquiry" target="_top">privacy@citypulseapp.com</a>.</p>

               </p><h2>2.	PROMOTIONAL CODES</h2>
               <p>
                   Dash may, in Dash’s sole discretion, create promotional codes that may be redeemed for Account credit or other features or benefits related to a Third Party Provider’s services, subject to terms that Dash establish on a per promotional code basis (“<i>Promo Codes</i>”). You acknowledge and agree that any terms and conditions outlined apply indiscriminately to: promotional codes, referral codes, referral credits or simply credits and these terms are overlapping. You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public, unless expressly permitted by Dash; (iii) may be disabled by Dash at any time for any reason without liability to Dash; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that Dash establish for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. Dash reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other user in the event that Dash determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.
               </p><p>
                   Dash may offer member accounts the ability to earn credits or discounts (“Referral Credits”) toward future purchases on Dash when they invite friends to create Dash accounts and those friends make a qualifying purchase. You may only earn Referral Credits via Dash’s authorized member invite mechanisms. Referrals outside of Dash authorized channels will not result in any Referral Credit. You understand that Referral Credits are not transferable, may not be auctioned, bartered or sold and may not be pooled with other members. You will only receive Referral Credit for the first qualifying purchase made by a friend after he or she makes his or her first purchase on the Dash Site as a result of an invite from you via a Dash authorized channel. If your friend does not follow the directions in the invite email or other valid invite mechanism to accept the invitation, you may not receive Referral Credit, and Dash will have no liability to you whatsoever.
               </p><p>
                   You agree that having multiple Dash accounts is a violation of these Terms and Conditions and that sending invites to alternate email addresses or accounts or otherwise attempting to circumvent Dash's Referral Credit program system may, without limiting any other Dash rights or remedies, result in forfeiture of your member account and all Referral Credits in your account. Dash reserves the right to void referrals and Referral Credits earned if we suspect that the referrals or Referral Credits were earned in a fraudulent manner, in a manner that violates these Terms and Conditions or in a manner otherwise not intended by Dash. You must not conduct your own promotion in connection with our Referral Credit program. You may not engage in any promotional, marketing, or other advertising activities on behalf of Dash, including by using any trademarks of Dash.
               </p><p>
                   Referral Credits will appear in your account within approximately 24 hours after one of your qualifying invitees makes his or her qualifying purchase.
               </p><p>
                   The Referral Credit program is void where prohibited by law. Dash reserves the right to modify or terminate the Referral Credit program at any time. Should there be any tax liability for the accumulation and/or use of Referral Credits, such taxes are the sole responsibility of the participant. You understand that your account may not accurately reflect the Referral Credits you have actually earned. Dash will have no liability for any errors displayed in your account.

               </p><h2>3.	PAYMENT</h2>
               <p>
	       <strong>Payment of Your Check in Third Party Establishments:</strong> You acknowledge that should you use the Service to settle or pay for a check, bill, tab or other payment in a third-party establishment (including but not limited to a restaurant, pub, bar, wine bar or tavern), a minimum tip or gratuity may be included which is determined by the restaurant or bar. Any third-party establishment which you frequent and which allows you to use the Service to settle or pay for a check, bill, tab or other payment retains the right to settle your payment should you fail to properly settle your outstanding balance either as a result of your failure to use the Service to pay for your balance or as a result of the Service to fail to properly pay such owed payment.In addition, should you fail to properly settle your outstanding balance a standard 20% tip or gratuity will be included as part of your payment to the third-party establishment. 
	       </p><p>
	       Any restaurant or other establishment that allows you to use the Service to pay for any outstanding check, bill, tab or other balance retains the right to request that you authorize such payment by other means including, but not limited to, signing a printed receipt, prior to delivering a final check, bill or tab to you. You acknowledge that, should you dispute any charge that appears on your credit or debit card statement related to your use of the Service to pay for a check, bill, tab or other balance in a third-party establishment, any chargeback for such charge shall apply to such third-party establishment and that Dash shall not be liable to you according to these Terms of Service.
               </p><p>
                   You understand that use of the Services may result in payments by you for the services you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges”). You acknowledge that payment cannot be made by any type of prepaid card. After you have received services obtained through your use of the Service, Dash will facilitate payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider, as such Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent, using the default payment method designated in your Account, and will send you a receipt by email. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Dash. If a Third Party Provider wants to provide refund to customer, Third Party Provider must communicate this to Dash and it is solely Dash’s responsibility to determine if this is a valid request and grant this request. A Third Party Provider cannot act on the behalf of Dash and you understand that any promises made by a Third Party Provider are not valid until approved by Dash in its sole and absolute discretion.
               </p><p>
                   All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Dash using the default payment method designated in your Account. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Dash may, as the Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent, attempt to reprocess the payment using the same payment method and, or use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
